[Project Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1/overview) 

## Project Description

This project focuses on binary classification task, specifically predicting customer churn in a bank. The main goal is to learn to predict whether a customer will close their account or continue using it.

## Project Highlights

* The project utilizes a dataset containing information about bank customers, such as their credit score, age, balance, number of products, etc.
* It includes steps of exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a neural network model using PyTorch and scikit-learn libraries.
* Visualizations are implemented to explore data distributions, correlation matrix, as well as changes in loss function and accuracy of the model over training epochs.

## Environment Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, torch, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage

1. Download the bank customer data.
2. Run the notebook or script for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
3. Analyze the results and fine-tune model parameters if necessary.
